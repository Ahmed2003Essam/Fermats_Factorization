# Fermats_Factorization

This C++ code is based on the fact that every odd number can be represented as a difference of squares of two numbers. 

Fermat's Factorization algorithm: 
Input: a positive odd number n 
Output: a factor of n, or message stating that n is a prime. 

Step1: Begin with x = $\lfloor \sqrt{n}\rfloor$
